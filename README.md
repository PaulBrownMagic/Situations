## Situations

This repository provides the top-level definition for interpretations of
Situations in Logtalk.

Examples include:
    - [SitCalc](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/SitCalc)
	- [STRIPState](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/STRIPState)

A library implementing these protocols is suitable for use with
[BedSit](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/BedSit) for developing
applications quickly and flexibly.

An additional category is provided to use queries with `holds/2`.
